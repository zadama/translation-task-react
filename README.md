# Lost in Translation Task - React

This web application uses React and has one main feature. The application act as a "translator" from regular text to American sign language.
It has three pages: login-page, translation-page and a profile-page. 
### Login-page:
This is the first page and on this page the user can enter their name. Once the name has been stored on the browser, the app redirects the user to the translation-page.
### Translation-page:
The user can type in words into the input box and then click on "translate" to display the sign language.
### Profile-page: 
The last 10 translations is stored in the profile-page. If there is already 10 translations stored, the oldest translation is removed.
The "logout button" clears all the storage and return the user to the start page.

### Demo of the app: https://translation-app-react.herokuapp.com/


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
